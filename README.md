README for Marvel API Example

This HTML file demonstrates how to make requests to the Marvel API using JavaScript. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Get Marvel API Keys:
   - Go to the Marvel Developer Portal (https://developer.marvel.com/).
   - Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.
   - Create a new application to obtain your Marvel API public and private keys.

2. Replace Keys in the HTML File:
   - Open the "index.html" file in a text editor.
   - Replace 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY' with your actual Marvel API public key.
   - Replace 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY' with your actual Marvel API private key.

3. Save the HTML File:
   - After replacing the keys, save the HTML file.

4. Open the HTML File in a Browser:
   - Double-click on the "index.html" file to open it in a web browser.

5. Check the Console:
   - Open the browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect" or "Developer Tools").
   - You should see the timestamp and MD5 hash printed in the console.

Note:
- This example generates a timestamp and MD5 hash based on your public and private keys, which can be used as part of the authentication process when making requests to the Marvel API.
- Ensure that you keep your Marvel API private key secure and do not expose it in public repositories or web pages.
